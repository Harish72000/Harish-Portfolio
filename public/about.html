<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey There,<br />
  Harish Here.<br />
  I am from Tamil Nadu, India. I was a Recruitment Consultant in my early career. I always love exploring and experimenting with technology. I was excited about every phase of the technological evolution. Moreover, I am creative and passionate about how websites work.
  And That is how I turned into a Full Stack Developer. <br />
  Right now, I love building cool websites.

  Apart from building websites, I have a huge craze for Investing.
  I am excited about IPOs, Equity, Startup Investing, and Real Estate.
  Being an Investment Enthusiast, I would like to explore, research, and build a portfolio that should shoot to the north.

  From my school days, I had an intense interest in photography. I had done event photography when I was a student. Later I used to spend my spare time doing light painting and astrophotography.
  Photography is one thing that I love doing for all my life.
